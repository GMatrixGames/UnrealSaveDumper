Unreal Save Dumper (USD)
------------------------

USD is a program that allows you to dump an Unreal Engine 4/5 `.sav` file to json format. This allows you to view the Unreal versioning information such as the Package Version, current Engine Version with branch and CL, and the array of Custom Versions. All used for properly parsing the game's files as engine version doesn't always mean the same between games!

On games such as Fortnite, and maybe others in the future, it also provides the save game data, such as keybinds.

### Usage:
Run the program and follow the program's instructions. If there any issues, please let me know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/GMatrixGames/UnrealSaveDumper/issues/new) and specify the game name and provide your save file.

### License:
USD is licensed under [GPL-3](https://github.com/GMatrixGames/UnrealSaveDumper/blob/master/LICENSE), and licenses of third-party libraries used are listed [here](https://github.com/GMatrixGames/UnrealSaveDumper/blob/master/NOTICE).
